# Online-Food-Delivery-App
This project is an Online Food Delivery System built using SQL and PL/SQL. It is a database management system that stores and manages data for restaurants and cafes including customers, restaurants, menu items, categories, payments, deliveries, reviews, offers, bookings, and feedback. Customers can place food orders online from local restaurants and have them delivered to their chosen address. The system keeps track of important details such as restaurant ID, restaurant name, address, ratings, and menu items, as well as customer ID, customer name, address, reviews, and order details. Admins can add or remove restaurants and customers, and manage customer profiles. The main purpose of the project is to maintain restaurant and food ordering functions in an effective, accurate, and organized way, while also making it easier to fetch information when required.
